 # I'll probably code this in a different coding language to make it smaller
update 1.0

delete coordinates button
lmk if it has any bugs
# too lazy to make it 25 megabytes or smaller so either do "python Deoautoclicker.py" or get pyinstaller with pip and do "pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile Deoautoclicker.py" make sure you do cd (where the script is located) when you run one of these or it just wont work if you pyinstaller it (if you didnt know pyinstaller makes it a exe) the exe is in disc or wtv that folders called and you can delete the other stuff it makes and it might leave some temp folders so just get rid of those if you wanna save some space
